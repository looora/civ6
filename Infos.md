## Situational or civ-related tips
* City States:
  * Toronto: production & amenities late game (boosts range of Industrial Zones and Entertainment Districts by 3)
  * Kumasi: culture late game (Trade Routes gain +2 Culture for every district)
  * Nan Mandol: water maps (+2 Culture for tiles on or next to coast)
* Scythia:
  * Build Kurgans early for snowballing your culture early game (Pantheon -> God of the Open Sky)

## General Tips
* Production: 
  * Unique districts do not count towards the district cap and are cheaper to construct.
* Resources: 
  * If units require strategic resources, please note that you only need 2 copies of that resource in your whole empire in order to build them in any city (1 copy if the city has an encampment).                 
* Units:
  * Horsemen are no melee units, eventhough they attack in melee (horsemen = cavalry)
  * Military Engineers can build missile silos which are used to launch nukes. That way it's possible to nuke somebody at the same turn as the silo has been built.
  * Spies can get captured by civs and are tradeable in the diplomatic screens with the AI
* War:
  * Razing cities remove the city from the map instantly... and it can only be done right after the conquest of a city.
* City States
  * When entering a new era, city state missions change!
* Civics
  * Unlocking Monarchy will change Maneuver to NOT work with your horsemen (incl. Saka Horse Archers), in addition Feudalism will change your agoge card into feudal contract which will also stop working with your horsemen (incl. Saka).
* Trade
  * Start a Trade Route from your second city early to quickly boost your new city.

## Tips memorized or tested
* Production: 
  * Building a settler will now cause your city to decrease its pop size by 1
  * If you dont have city walls, you won't be able to attack with your city (!)
* Resources: 
  * Copper & crabs now count as bonus resources instead of luxury resources
  * If barbarians spawn nearby horses, they will produce horse barbs which are much stronger
* Units:
  * When you capture a settler from the AI in Civ 6, you actually get that settler as opposed to a worker in Civ 5.
* War:
  * When making peace deals with the AI, make sure to let the AI cede (=abtreten) the already conquered cities. Otherwise they'll just get your conquered city back instead.
