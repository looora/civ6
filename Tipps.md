## General
* Production: 
  * Building a settler will now cause your city to decrease its pop size by 1
  * Unique districts do not count towards the district cap and are cheaper to construct.
  * If you dont have city walls, you won't be able to attack with your city (!)
* Resources: 
  * Copper & crabs now count as bonus resources instead of luxury resources
  * If units require strategic resources, please note that you only need 2 copies of that resource in your whole empire in order to build them in any city (1 copy if the city has an encampment).
  * If barbarians spawn nearby horses, they will produce horse barbs which are much stronger                 
* Units:
  * When you capture a settler from the AI in Civ 6, you actually get that settler as opposed to a worker in Civ 5.
  * Horsemen are no melee units, eventhough they attack in melee (horsemen = cavalry)
  * Military Engineers can build missile silos which are used to launch nukes. That way it's possible to nuke somebody at the same turn as the silo has been built.
  * Spies can get captured by civs and are tradeable in the diplomatic screens with the AI
* War:
  * Razing cities remove the city from the map instantly... and it can only be done right after the conquest of a city.
  * When making peace deals with the AI, make sure to let the AI cede (=abtreten) the already conquered cities. Otherwise they'll just get your conquered city back instead.
