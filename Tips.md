## 1a) New Tips
* Buenos Aires
* Copies of luxury resources **currently** don't give amenities to more cities, as intended by the devs.
* The treasury can only display a minimum of 0. If it drops below,units begin disbanding because of "negative gold income".
* A liberated city will act as a new capital, if the original capital is already captured. Counts for Domination Victory!
* Unique districts do not count towards the district cap and are cheaper to construct.
* If units require strategic resources, please note that you only need 2 copies of that resource in your whole empire in order to build them in any city (1 copy if the city has an encampment).                 
* Horsemen are no melee units, eventhough they attack in melee (horsemen = cavalry)
* Military Engineers can build missile silos which are used to launch nukes. That way it's possible to nuke somebody at the same turn as the silo has been built.
* Spies can get captured by civs and are tradeable in the diplomatic screens with the AI
* Unlocking Monarchy will change Maneuver to NOT work with your horsemen (incl. Saka Horse Archers), in addition Feudalism will change your agoge card into feudal contract which will also stop working with your horsemen (incl. Saka).
* Start a Trade Route from your second city early to quickly boost your new city.

## 1b) Needs Testing
* Units fortify immediately when placed on a great wall. Enemy units do that too!
* You get the resources that spawn under wonders (what about districts?)
* The Factory grants 3 production to any city within 6 tiles.
* When entering a new era, city state missions change!
* Razing cities remove the city from the map instantly... and it can only be done right after the conquest of a city.
* If you dont have city walls, you won't be able to attack with your city. If walls are built in the city, the encampment also gains a ranged attack.

## 2) Memorized Tips
* Building a settler will now cause your city to decrease its pop size by 1
* Copper & crabs now count as bonus resources instead of luxury resources
* If barbarians spawn nearby horses, they will produce horse barbs which are much stronger
* When you capture a settler from the AI in Civ 6, you actually get that settler as opposed to a worker in Civ 5.
* When making peace deals with the AI, make sure to let the AI cede (=abtreten) the already conquered cities. Otherwise they'll just get your conquered city back instead.
